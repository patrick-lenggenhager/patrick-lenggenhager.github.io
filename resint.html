				<h3>Research Interests</h3>


<p>My main research interests revolve around <strong>topological band theory</strong> and <strong>materials</strong>.
I am studying various properties of topological bandstructures, such as momentum space degeneracies (<em>band nodes</em>), <em>topological invariants</em> and their relation to symmetries.
In particular, I am interested in a multi-band perspective on the above topics.
My work encompasses both working with simple toy models illustrating and/or demonstrating novel topological phenomena as well as simulating/modeling real materials to study possibly observable effects such as <em>transport signatures</em>.</p>

<p>I am finishing up a larger project about <em>triple (nodal) points</em>, which are degeneracies of three bands in momentum space.
We have complete the missing classification of those band nodes in the absence of spin (which applies to systems where spin-orbit interactions are negligible but also to many other systems such as photons, phonons, magnons including may metamaterials) and have found a <strong>universal higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence</strong>.
For more information, check out the <a href="/projects/2020/08/06/TriplePoints.html">project description</a>.</p>

<p>I have also been working on implementing and investigating models of <strong>condensed matter on hyperbolic lattices</strong>, that is lattices in <em>negatively curved space</em>.
In contrast to positively curved spaces, such as the surface of a sphere, the negative counterpart cannot be embedded in three-dimensional space.
However, we have implemented and measured a <a href="/publications/2021/09/02/HyperbolicDrum.html"><strong>hyperbolic lattice in electric circuits</strong></a>, thereby establishing circuits as a platform to study interesting models on hyperbolic lattices.
On the theory side, we have studied fundamental model of topological band insulators on hyperbolic lattices.</p>

<p>More recently, I have become interested (again) in applying (quantum) information to study condensed matter systems.</p>

<p>Besides these main parts of my research I am also interested in other topics, on some of which I have previously worked while others might lead to future projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interplay of non-Abelian topology with interactions</li>
  <li>Transport and non-equilibrium physics / Floquet systems (Master thesis)</li>
  <li>Information theory and statistical physics (see this <a href="/publications/2020/02/14/OptimalRG.html">paper</a>)</li>
  <li>Field theoretical methods in condensed matter theory</li>
</ul>
